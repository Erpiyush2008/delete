It is a fine example of Rajput architecture, combining elements of Hindu and Mughal styles.
The Amber Fort was originally built by Raja Man Singh. Jai Singh I expanded it in the early 1600's. 
Improvements and additions were made by successive rulers over the next 150 years, until 
the Kachwahas shifted their capital to Jaipur during the time of Sawai Jai Singh II, in 1727.
